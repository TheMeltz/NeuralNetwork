# Neural Network Program

## Overview

This program implements a simple neural network using C++. The neural network consists of an input layer, one hidden layer with ReLU activation, and an output layer with sigmoid activation. The program includes functionalities for training the neural network using backpropagation.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler
- CMake
